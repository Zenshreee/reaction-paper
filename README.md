[Final Reaction Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MCd79B-lNjZ4rjVxkzKMa4MYyHNQoaeI/view?usp=sharing)

The first part of our final project for CS 6850: The Structure of Information Networks @ Cornell. In Fall 2023, we were advised by [Jon Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/). This repo shares the code used for the analysis of our drone-scheduling algorithm, a hybrid approach inspired by these two papers:

- Saswata Jana and Partha Sarathi Mandal. _Approximation algorithms for drone delivery scheduling
problem._
- Chase C. Murray and Amanda G. Chu. _The flying sidekick traveling salesman problem: Optimization of
drone-assisted parcel delivery._
